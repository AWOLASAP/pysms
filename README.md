# pysms
Open Source python interpreter that allows code to be ran off a host computer and outputs via text.

# Operating Systems
Currently this only works with Macos and maybe linux distrubutions(needs to be tested), as it uses bash to function.

# Future imporvements
Currently working on getting the type of error to be outputed instead of just telling the user there is an error.
